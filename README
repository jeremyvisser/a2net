A2Net - IPv6 stack for Apple //e
Copyright (c) 2023 Jeremy Visser

Overview
========

This was a fun educational project for me so that I could ping my Apple //e
over IPv6 using ICMP echo requests.

Limitations
===========

Currently, you can only respond to pings.

It doesn't support UDP, TCP, or anything useful.

It's also unreliable above 1200 baud, where it starts dropping bytes. I'm sure
it's fixable with sufficient debugging, as the Apple //e itself is perfectly
capable of consuming 19200 baud data using ProTerm or Modem.Mgr.

Requirements
============

- CC65
- Apple //e with Super Serial Card (SSC) and ProDOS
- PC connected via serial, capable of running SLIP

Building
========

Assuming CC65 is installed and working, run `make`, which will output
a ProDOS a2net.system binary.

Running
=======

Transfer the `a2net` binary to a ProDOS system by some means. Suggestions:

-   Use AppleCommander (https://applecommander.github.io/) to place the binary
    on a disk image, e.g.:
      $ java -jar ac.jar -as my.dsk < a2net

    And then use ADTPro to transfer the disk image to a floppy or RAM disk.

-   Use ProTerm or Modem.Mgr to transfer the binary using Xmodem or similar.

Once on the system, from BASIC you can just run (including the literal hyphen):

  -A2NET.SYSTEM

PC side
=======

You need to run SLIP. My suggestion is SLIRP (https://slirp.sourceforge.net/).
I no longer have notes for the exact config required, but basically you'll need
to point SLIRP at the serial port connected to your Apple //e serial card.
